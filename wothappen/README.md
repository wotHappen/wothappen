# WotHappen

What did Joe talk about during that last meeting two weeks ago? Did the conversation last month in the team space seem...toxic? WotHappen helps you gather massive amounts of chat data in your Cisco Spark messaging app and employs natural language processing (NLP) to summarize, provide insights, and keep your team space under control.
